# 26‑01 // Operation: Rising Eagle

> *All information has been provided.*

You scanned a coin. You found a page. That already says a lot about you.

---

## Orientation (short on words, long on winks)
- Read what’s here. Then read what isn’t.
- Nothing here needs a login, a VPN, or an apology email.
- If you’re pushing buttons harder than you push ideas, you’re off track.
- Proceed when ready. Or when curious. (Curious usually wins.)

## Lightly‑worded guidance
- Don’t break anything—digital or otherwise.
- Brute force is for door hinges, not puzzles.
- If something looks serious, it probably isn’t. If it looks silly, pay attention.
- Screens have edges; so do pages, headers, and other… margins.
